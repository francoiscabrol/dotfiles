# Glacier

[Glacier](http://glaciertheme.com) is a flat, colorful theme/scheme combo for Sublime Text. It focuses on using saturated colors to introduce more contrast and visual interest compared to other flat approaches.

### Future Updates

This is my first time writing a theme/color scheme for Sublime, so I have much to learn. As I learn more about styling bits and pieces of the UI, I will make improvements. Please feel free to open issues as you see fit, fork and improve, or contact/follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/joeyfigaro).
